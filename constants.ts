export const LETTER_TEXT = `Hello there my Tanvi pa, 
Let me tell u how dual nature works here, we have definitely come a long way yet we haven’t, thats because we are here after all the ups and downs that we had, but, end of the day here we are, together, loving each other, I mean is there any other thing that would make me happier than this? Probably not. We have so much of life to see so many problems just staring right at us patiently waiting for us to reach but are they gonna do us harm? Not at all not under my watch, let me tell you something that i will tell you every birthday of yours, Im there and i always will be, I will always love you and I promise it’ll always be you and only you, im yours and only yours forever. Youre turning freaking 19!!!! I dont know if i should be happy i get to celebrate your birthday again, or if i should be sad because youve lived one more year off your life time, man i cant wait to get old with you, i dont know how you just manage to bring in so much clarity in my life im actually shocked because you alone changed my life, how i think, how i react, my feed(im a girl now). Oh my goodness, what god did you pray to, to get all your super powers. I am really so thankful for all the love and care you bring in to my life. Im just speechless, you give in so much efforts into us so much of care so much of time and yet you utter the line “I DONT DO ANYTHING”...i should definitely be pissed at you for that, but there’s a problem there…How can i be pissed at the prettiest, cutest, most beautiful girl i know, i mean god gave me eyes just to look at you and be dazzled. Coming back to my girl’s birthday, im soooo damn excited, i just wanna give u a biggg hug for being so strong throughout and being so supportive, I just cant express how much i love my sweet girl and i so proud of you! 

Happy Birthday Sweetheart. 

I love you, Beyond measure.`;
